# airBlast
## This is an extremely simple dummy script that allows you to :
	•   Kills and relaunches key macOS daemons and user-space processes involved in:
	•	AirDrop state propagation
	•	Network interface refresh(es)
	•	Control Center updates
	•	Finder view consistency
	•	Rebuilds the Control Center (CC) stack to fix badge desyncs (e.g., AirDrop not showing “Receiving” properly).
	•	Restarts Finder to ensure the UI reflects the actual file/network state after system changes.
